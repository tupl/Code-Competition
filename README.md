# CodeCompetition
The purpose of this repository is to help the learning
of algorithm by taking a look at its implementation and
various competitions. The repository will be updated
overtime. Hopefully, it will grow up really big in the
future. Moreover, I am planning to build a search engine
for this one so other programmer can easily find what
they need. Anyways, that's for the future

The repository will be divided into two basic parts
+Basic folder: Implementation of algorithms in python/cpp/java
	Incremental algorithm
	Graham scan (Coming soon)
	Divide and conquer(Coming soon)
	Gift Wrapping (Coming soon)
	Graph
+Template folder: short implementation of all algorithm
    in language including c++, python, java. The purpose
    of this one is for quick typing the algorithm to apply
    for a problem to come up with quick solution.
+Competition folder:
    Code for various programming competition written
	in python, java, c with solutions (Maybe good or bad)
    For me, I mostly use python for many problems if
	speed is not that important or it does not require
	advaned library like red black tree. If it does,
	I prefer switching into Java for easier coding
	(But it comes with a price of verbosity). For
	bit manipulation, I prefer C.
