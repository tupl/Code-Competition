## Code Competition ##


----------

The purpose of this repository is to help the learning
of algorithm by taking a look at its implementation and
various competitions. The repository will be updated
overtime. Hopefully, it will grow up really big in the
future. Moreover, I am planning to build a search engine
for this one so other programmer can easily find what
they need. Anyways, that's for the future

The repository will be divided into two basic parts
# Basic folder: #


----------

- Graham scan (Coming soon)
- Divide and conquer(Coming soon)
- Gift Wrapping (Coming soon)
- Graph algorithm


# Template folder: (will be removed soon) # 

# Competition folder: #
Code for various programming competition written
in python, java, c++ with solutions (Maybe good or bad)
For me, I mostly use python for many problems if
speed is not that important or it does not require
advaned library like red black tree. If it does,
I prefer switching into Java for easier coding
(But it comes with a price of verbosity). For
bit manipulation, I prefer C++.
